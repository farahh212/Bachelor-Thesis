\label{chap:ai_usage}

This thesis has been developed with the assistance of artificial intelligence tools, primarily for code development, synthetic dataset analysis, and text editing purposes. AI tools, including large language models, were utilized to support the implementation of machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing pipelines, and the analytical scoring system. The use of AI was particularly valuable in exploring different analytical approaches, debugging code, and generating initial drafts of technical documentation.

All research questions, methodological decisions, experimental design, results, and final interpretations remain my own. The AI tools served as assistants in the technical implementation and writing process, but the core research contributions, analytical framework development, and critical evaluation of results were conducted independently. All code, analyses, and conclusions have been carefully reviewed and validated to ensure accuracy and scientific rigor.
