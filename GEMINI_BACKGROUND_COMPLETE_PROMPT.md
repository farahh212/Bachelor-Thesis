## SLIDE 1: MOTIVATION AND CONNECTION TYPES OVERVIEW

### Purpose
Establish what shaft-hub connections are, why selection matters, and introduce the three connection types being studied.

### Content Structure

**Part A: What are Shaft-Hub Connections?**
- Definition: Mechanical interface between rotating shaft and hub
- Purpose: Transmit torque and rotational motion reliably without relative slip
- Applications: Electric motors, gearboxes, pumps, automotive drivetrains
- Requirements: Must transmit required torque with adequate safety, avoid excessive stress concentrations, maintain alignment under dynamic loading, satisfy manufacturing and maintenance constraints

**Part B: Why is Selection Challenging?**
- Failure consequences: Slippage, fretting, shaft damage, catastrophic system failure
- Current practice: Engineer experience, handbook charts, repeated analytical checks → manual and time-consuming
- Complexity factors:
  - Torque capacity depends on interacting geometric, material, and surface parameters
  - Three distinct connection types have fundamentally different load paths
  - User/application preferences often override pure mechanical capacity
  - Standards (DIN 7190, DIN 6885, DIN 5480) define rules but don't guide selection
- Data scarcity: No publicly available labeled datasets exist (proprietary knowledge)

**Part C: Three Connection Types**
- Two main categories:
  - **Friction Closure:** Press fits
  - **Form Closure:** Keys, Splines
- Three types considered:
  1. **Interference (Press) Fits** (Friction Closure) - DIN 7190
  2. **Parallel Keys** (Form Closure) - DIN 6885
  3. **Splines** (Form Closure) - DIN 5480

**Visual Elements:**
- **Primary figure:** 3D models diagram (figures/3D-Modelle.png)
  - Shows: press fit (PV), multi-part press fit (MPV), knurled press fit (RPV), splined connection (ZWV), keyed connection (PFV)
  - Caption: "Three-dimensional models illustrating torque transmission mechanisms (friction closure, form closure, or combination)"
  - Source: own illustration/results (if applicable)

**Key Message:**
"Each type exhibits characteristic strengths and limitations. Standards-based feasibility alone rarely determines the final design choice; further analysis is typically needed, especially when multiple connection types are feasible."

**Transition to next slide:**
"Let's examine each connection type in detail, starting with press fits..."

## SLIDE 2: PRESS FITS - FRICTION CLOSURE (DIN 7190)

### Purpose
Explain press fit mechanics, torque transmission principles, and key characteristics.

### Content Structure

**Part A: Basic Mechanism**
- Torque transmission: Via friction generated by radial interference
- Assembly methods:
  - Shrink fit: Hub heated or shaft cooled
  - Press fit: Force-assembled at ambient temperature
- Result: Radial contact pressure p develops at interface after temperature equalization and elastic recovery

**Part B: Torque Capacity Equation**
- Contact area: A_contact = π d L
- Torque equation: **M_t,press = (π/2) μ p L d²**
  - μ = friction coefficient
  - p = interface pressure
  - L = engagement length
  - d = shaft diameter
- Required pressure: p_req = (2 M_req S_R) / (π μ L d²)
  - S_R = safety factor applied to torque demand
  - Safety factor applied directly to torque demand (not capacity)

**Part C: Allowable Pressure**
- Effective allowable: p_allow = min(p_allow,shaft, p_allow,hub)
- Based on von Mises yield criterion for biaxial stress state
- Factors affecting allowable:
  - Material strength (yield or ultimate, depending on ductility)
  - Geometric configuration (hub wall thickness Q_A = d/D, shaft hollowness Q_I = d_i/d)
  - Thick-walled cylinder theory

**Part D: Key Characteristics**
- **Advantages:**
  - Excellent concentricity (self-centering, uniform radial contact)
  - Backlash-free operation (no clearance, friction resists motion in both directions)
  - Low stress concentration (smooth interface, no geometric discontinuities)
  - Good for high-speed, low-vibration applications
- **Limitations:**
  - Assembly constraints (high press forces or thermal methods)
  - Surface condition sensitivity (contamination, oxidation, lubrication reduce friction)
  - Thin hub limitations (bell-mouthing, non-uniform deformation)
  - Interference limits (practical manufacturability constraints, typically U_w ≤ 0.020mm)

**Visual Elements:**
- **Primary figure:** Press fit properties radar chart (figures/press_fit_properties.png)
- **Secondary figure (optional):** Friction coefficients table (figures/press_friction_coefficients_DIN7190.pdf.png)

**Key Message:**
"Press fits provide excellent concentricity and backlash-free operation but are limited by assembly constraints and interference manufacturability limits."

**Transition to next slide:**
"Unlike press fits, keys and splines use form closure through geometric interlocking..."

---

## SLIDE 3: KEYS AND SPLINES - FORM CLOSURE (DIN 6885, DIN 5480)

### Purpose
Explain keyed and splined connection mechanics, failure modes, and characteristics.

### Content Structure

**Part A: Parallel Keys (DIN 6885)**
- Mechanism: Rectangular parallel key engages matching keyways in shaft and hub
- Torque transmission: Via geometric interlocking (form closure)

**Two Failure Modes:**
1. **Shear Failure:**
   - Key cut across by torque
   - Shear-limited capacity: T_τ = τ_allow × b × L × d/2
2. **Bearing (Crushing) Failure:**
   - Key presses against keyway walls
   - Bearing-limited capacity: T_p = p_allow × (h/2) × L × d/2
   - **Usually governs**, especially for:
     - Larger shafts (torque scales with d³, but key size increases linearly)
     - Softer hub materials (cast iron, aluminum, mild steel have lower compressive yield strength)

**Governing Capacity:**
- M_t,key = min(T_τ, T_p)
- For multi-material connections: p_allow = min(p_allow,shaft, p_allow,hub)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Advantages:** Low cost, easy assembly/disassembly, good for moderate torque
- **Limitations:** Stress concentrations at keyways, potential backlash, poor concentricity

**Part B: Splines (DIN 5480)**
- Mechanism: Multiple interlocking teeth engage matching grooves
- Torque transmission: Via load sharing across multiple teeth

**Torque Capacity:**
- M_t,spline = K × L × z × h_eff × r_m × p_allow
  - z = number of teeth
  - m = module
  - K = load-sharing factor (0.75, accounts for non-uniform load distribution)
  - h_eff ≈ 0.8 × h_proj (effective flank height, conservative reduction)
  - r_m = (d + D)/4 (mean radius)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Advantages:** High torque capacity, excellent fatigue behavior, good concentricity, suitable for axial movement
- **Limitations:** High manufacturing cost, increased complexity

**Visual Elements:**
- Key fit diagram (figures/keyfit_diagram.png or figures/key_DIN.jpg)
- Spline diagram (figures/spline_diagram.png)
- Key and spline properties radar charts

**Key Message:**
"Keys offer cost-effective solutions for moderate torque with easy assembly, but suffer from stress concentrations. Splines provide high capacity and durability but at higher manufacturing cost. Bearing pressure often governs in keyed joints, especially for larger shafts or softer hub materials."

**Transition to next slide:**
"These connection types are governed by DIN standards. Let's examine the standards and material considerations..."

---

## SLIDE 4: DIN STANDARDS AND MATERIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Purpose
Explain the role of DIN standards in analytical modeling and material/contact mechanics principles.

### Content Structure

**Part A: DIN Standards Overview**
- **DIN 7190 (Press Fits/Interference Fits):**
  - Basis for friction-closure connections
  - Defines friction coefficients (Haftbeiwerte) for material pairings and surface conditions
  - Provides formulas for pressure limits based on thick-walled cylinder theory
- **DIN 6885 (Parallel Keys):**
  - Standardized key dimensions as function of shaft diameter
  - Defines keyway tolerances
  - Torque capacity based on shear and bearing pressure limits
- **DIN 5480 (Splines):**
  - Involute spline geometry based on reference diameters
  - Defines module, number of teeth, tolerances
  - Load sharing considerations

**Key Point:** "Standards define feasibility boundaries but do not prescribe how to select between multiple feasible connection types."

**Part B: Material Properties**
- Materials considered: Structural/alloy steels (S235, C45, 42CrMo4, E360, 16MnCr5), stainless steel (304), cast irons (GG25, GGG40), bronze (CuSn8), aluminum alloys (6061, 7075)
- Key properties:
  - Elastic constants: Young's modulus E, Poisson's ratio ν
  - Strength values: Yield strength σ_y, ultimate tensile strength σ_uts
  - Ductility classification (ductile vs brittle)
  - Safety modifiers: S_F (yield-based), S_B (ultimate-based)

**Part C: Contact Mechanics**
- **For Form-Closure (Keys, Splines):**
  - Allowable shear stresses: Material-specific
  - Bearing pressure limits: Conservative, governed by weaker component
  - p_allow = min(p_allow,shaft, p_allow,hub) for multi-material connections
- **For Friction-Closure (Press Fits):**
  - Friction coefficient μ sensitive to:
    - Material pairing (steel-steel vs steel-aluminum)
    - Surface condition (dry or oiled)
    - Surface roughness
  - Conservative ranges from DIN practice

**Visual Elements:**
- DIN standard diagrams (press_friction_coefficients_DIN7190.pdf.png, key_DIN.jpg, spline_DIN.jpg)
- Optional: Hooke's law diagram, stress-strain curve

**Key Message:**
"Material properties and DIN standards provide the analytical foundation. Standards define feasibility, but selection requires additional considerations beyond pure mechanical capacity."

**Transition to next slide:**
"Before we can compare connection types, we need to establish feasibility and consider user preferences..."

---

## SLIDE 5: FEASIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS AND PREFERENCE-BASED TRADE-OFFS

### Purpose
Explain how feasibility is established and how user preferences influence selection beyond pure mechanical capacity.

### Content Structure

**Part A: Feasibility Considerations**
- **Basic requirement:** Connection must transmit required torque with appropriate safety margin
- **Mechanical feasibility:**
  - Torque capacity ≥ design torque (M_req × S_R)
  - Within admissible material limits (yield strength, ultimate strength)
  - Within geometric limits (diameter ratios, wall thickness)
- **Practical feasibility:**
  - Avoid non-physical designs (invalid diameter relationships)
  - Avoid unrealistically difficult assembly (e.g., excessive interference)
  - Press fits: Interference limits (typically U_w ≤ 0.020mm for manufacturability)
- **Key point:** "Feasibility serves as prerequisite to preference-based evaluation. Only feasible connections are considered for selection."

**Part B: Preference-Based Engineering Trade-Offs**
- **Problem:** Engineering decisions involve trade-offs beyond torque capacity alone
- **Eight preference dimensions:**
  1. Assembly and disassembly ease
  2. Suitability for axial movement
  3. Cost sensitivity
  4. Bidirectional torque capability
  5. Vibration resistance
  6. High-speed suitability
  7. Maintenance effort and accessibility
  8. Durability and fatigue-related considerations

**Part C: Why Preferences Matter**
- Different connection types exhibit characteristic strengths and weaknesses across these dimensions
- Example trade-offs:
  - Press fits: Excellent concentricity, but difficult disassembly
  - Keys: Low cost, easy assembly, but stress concentrations
  - Splines: High capacity, but high manufacturing cost
- **User-defined preference weighting:** Enables selection decisions that reflect application-specific priorities
- **Key point:** "Selection should not rely solely on mechanical capacity. User preferences enable context-aware decisions."

**Visual Elements:**
- Optional comparison table showing connection types across 8 preference dimensions
- Simple flowchart: Feasibility filter → Preference scoring → Selection

**Key Message:**
"Feasibility ensures mechanical safety, but preferences enable application-specific optimization. Both are essential for intelligent selection."

**Transition to next slide:**
"Now let's understand how machine learning fits into this framework..."

## SLIDE 6: MACHINE LEARNING CONCEPTS

### Purpose
Explain machine learning fundamentals, supervised classification, and tree-based models.

### Content Structure

**Part A: What is Machine Learning?**
- Definition: Enables computers to learn patterns from data without explicit programming
- **Role in this thesis:** Complements analytical models by learning subtle patterns and trade-offs difficult to encode explicitly
- **Analytical models:** Provide physically grounded calculations
- **ML models:** Capture complex interactions between multiple factors (geometry, materials, preferences)

**Part B: Supervised Classification**
- **Training process:**
  - Input features: Geometric parameters, materials, preferences
  - Target label: Connection type (determined by analytical scoring system)
  - Dataset split: Training (70-80%), Validation (10-15%), Test (10-20%)
  - Validation: Hyperparameter tuning
  - Test: Unbiased performance estimate
- **Overfitting prevention:** Regularization, early stopping, cross-validation

**Part C: Tree-Based Models**
- **Why tree-based?**
  - Represent nonlinear decision boundaries (mechanical feasibility constraints)
  - Handle mixed data types (numerical + categorical)
  - Well-suited for engineering problems

**Key Models:**
- **Decision Trees:** Hierarchical yes/no questions, but prone to overfitting
- **Random Forest:** Bagging (bootstrap aggregating), many independent trees vote
- **Gradient Boosting:** Sequential training, each tree corrects previous errors
  - **XGBoost:** Regularization, second-order optimization
  - **LightGBM:** Histogram-based, leaf-wise growth
  - **CatBoost:** Robust categorical handling, ordered boosting

**Part D: Synthetic Data Generation**
- **Concept:** Use analytical models as "labeling oracle"
- **Process:**
  1. Sample input parameters (geometry, torque, materials, preferences) within realistic, DIN-compliant ranges
  2. Pass through analytical selector (DIN-based calculations)
  3. Analytical system determines correct connection type → becomes class label
  4. Result: Large labeled dataset without requiring experiments or expert annotation
- **Advantages:**
  - Reflects engineering knowledge encoded in standards
  - Physically consistent (based on DIN standards)
  - Scalable (can generate thousands of examples)
  - No proprietary data needed

**Visual Elements:**
- Optional: Simple diagram showing supervised learning process
- Optional: Tree-based model comparison table

**Key Message:**
"Tree-based models are well-suited for this problem. Synthetic data generation enables ML training without empirical data by using analytical models as labeling oracles."

**Transition to next slide:**
"To assess model performance, we need evaluation metrics. Let's examine how we measure success..."

---

## SLIDE 7: EVALUATION METRICS AND CONFUSION MATRIX

### Purpose
Explain evaluation metrics used to assess ML model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, macro-averaging, and confusion matrix.

### Content Structure

**Part A: Classification Outcomes**
To understand evaluation metrics, we need to define fundamental classification outcomes for each class:
- **True Positives (TP):** Model correctly predicts the class
- **False Positives (FP):** Model incorrectly predicts the class when it should be another
- **True Negatives (TN):** Model correctly predicts a different class
- **False Negatives (FN):** Model incorrectly predicts a different class when it should be the target class

**Part B: Key Evaluation Metrics**

**1. Accuracy:**
- Measures overall percentage of correct predictions
- **Formula:** Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN) = Correct Predictions / Total Predictions
- **Limitation:** Can be misleading with imbalanced classes
  - A model that always predicts the majority class achieves high accuracy but fails to learn meaningful patterns

**2. Precision:**
- Measures reliability of positive predictions
- **Formula:** Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
- **Interpretation:** "Of all instances predicted as a class, how many were actually that class?"
- **High precision:** When model predicts a class, it is usually correct (reduces false alarms)

**3. Recall (Sensitivity):**
- Measures how well model finds all instances of a class
- **Formula:** Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
- **Interpretation:** "Of all actual instances of a class, how many were correctly identified?"
- **High recall:** Model successfully identifies most instances of a class (reduces missed detections)

**4. F1-Score:**
- Combines precision and recall as their harmonic mean
- **Formula:** F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = (2 × TP) / (2 × TP + FP + FN)
- **Why harmonic mean?** Penalizes extreme imbalances: if either precision or recall is low, F1-score will be low
- **Benefit:** Encourages balanced performance

**5. Macro F1-Score:**
- For multi-class problems, computes F1-score separately for each class, then takes simple average
- **Formula:** Macro F1 = (1/C) × Σ F1_i
  - C = number of classes
  - F1_i = F1-score for class i
- **Why macro-averaging?** Ensures all classes weighted equally, preventing dominant classes from masking poor performance on minority classes
- **Used for model selection in this thesis** (avoids favoring dominant classes)

**Part C: Confusion Matrix**
- **Purpose:** Detailed breakdown of classification performance
- **Structure:** 3×3 table (for 3-class problem: press fit, key, spline)
  - **Rows:** True classes
  - **Columns:** Predicted classes
  - **Diagonal elements:** Correct predictions (TP for each class)
  - **Off-diagonal elements:** Misclassifications (which classes are confused)
- **Use:** 
  - Qualitative error analysis
  - Identify systematic misclassification patterns
  - Example: "Do keys get confused with splines? Do press fits get confused with keys?"
- **Benefits:**
  - Shows which classes are most easily confused
  - Reveals systematic errors
  - Enables targeted improvements

**Part D: Why Macro F1-Score for This Thesis?**
- **Problem:** Class imbalance in dataset
  - Spline: 54.7% of samples
  - Key: 28.6% of samples
  - Press fit: 16.8% of samples
- **Solution:** Macro F1-score ensures balanced performance across all classes
- **Alternative (accuracy) would be misleading:** Model could achieve high accuracy by always predicting spline, but would fail on keys and press fits
- **Macro F1 ensures:** All three connection types are evaluated equally

**Visual Elements:**
- **Confusion matrix diagram (figures/conf-matrix3x3.png):**
  - Shows 3×3 structure for three-class problem
  - Illustrates how predictions are distributed
  - Rows = true classes, Columns = predicted classes
  - Diagonal = correct predictions
  - Off-diagonal = misclassifications
  - Source: researchgate_confusion_matrix_2021
- **Optional:** Simple diagram showing precision vs recall trade-off
- **Optional:** Formula summary table

**Key Message:**
"Macro F1-score ensures balanced performance across all classes, preventing dominant classes from masking poor performance. Confusion matrix reveals which connection types are most easily confused, enabling targeted improvements."

**Transition to next slide:**
"Let's examine the state of the art in engineering design automation to understand where this work fits..."

  - **Limitations:**
    - Brittleness (can't handle cases outside predefined rules)
    - Extensive maintenance as knowledge evolves
    - Struggle with multi-criteria trade-offs

**Part C: Machine Learning Promise and Challenge**
- **Promise:** Learn patterns directly from data, capture complex nonlinear relationships
- **Challenge:** Requires large, labeled datasets
- **Data sources:**
  - Experiments: Expensive and time-consuming

  - Examples: Raissi et al. 2019, Karniadakis et al. 2021
- **Surrogate modeling:**
  - ML approximates expensive simulations
  - Enables rapid design exploration
- **Limitation:** Most hybrid approaches still require some form of training data (simulations or experiments)

**Part E: Synthetic Data Generation**
- **Concept:** Use analytical models or simulations as "labeling oracles"
- **Advantage:** Generate large datasets reflecting engineering knowledge encoded in standards
- **Benefit:** Bridges gap between rule-based systems and data-driven methods
- **Result:** Enables machine learning while maintaining physical consistency

**Part F: This Thesis Contribution**
- **Problem context:** Shaft-hub connection selection sits at intersection of:
  - Multiple competing criteria
  - Mechanical constraints
  - Interpretable recommendations
  - Data-scarce environment
- **Solution approach:**
  1. Generate synthetic data from analytical models
  2. Train machine-learning classifiers on this data
