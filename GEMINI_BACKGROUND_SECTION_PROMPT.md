## SLIDE 1: MOTIVATION AND CONNECTION TYPES OVERVIEW

### Purpose
Establish what shaft-hub connections are, why selection matters, and introduce the three connection types being studied.

### Content Structure

**Part A: What are Shaft-Hub Connections?**
- Definition: Mechanical interface between rotating shaft and hub
- Purpose: Transmit torque and rotational motion reliably without relative slip
- Applications: Electric motors, gearboxes, pumps, automotive drivetrains
- Requirements: Must transmit required torque with adequate safety, avoid excessive stress concentrations, maintain alignment under dynamic loading, satisfy manufacturing and maintenance constraints

**Part B: Why is Selection Challenging?**
- Failure consequences: Slippage, fretting, shaft damage, catastrophic system failure
- Current practice: Engineer experience, handbook charts, repeated analytical checks → manual and time-consuming
- Complexity factors:
  - Torque capacity depends on interacting geometric, material, and surface parameters
  - Three distinct connection types have fundamentally different load paths
  - User/application preferences often override pure mechanical capacity
  - Standards (DIN 7190, DIN 6885, DIN 5480) define rules but don't guide selection
- Data scarcity: No publicly available labeled datasets exist (proprietary knowledge)

**Part C: Three Connection Types**
- Two main categories:
  - **Friction Closure:** Press fits
  - **Form Closure:** Keys, Splines
- Three types considered:
  1. **Interference (Press) Fits** (Friction Closure) - DIN 7190
  2. **Parallel Keys** (Form Closure) - DIN 6885
  3. **Splines** (Form Closure) - DIN 5480

**Visual Elements:**
- **Primary figure:** 3D models diagram (figures/3D-Modelle.png)
  - Shows: press fit (PV), multi-part press fit (MPV), knurled press fit (RPV), splined connection (ZWV), keyed connection (PFV)
  - Caption: "Three-dimensional models illustrating torque transmission mechanisms (friction closure, form closure, or combination)"
  - Source: own illustration/results (if applicable)

**Key Message:**
"Each type exhibits characteristic strengths and limitations. Standards-based feasibility alone rarely determines the final design choice; further analysis is typically needed, especially when multiple connection types are feasible."

**Transition to next slide:**
"Let's examine each connection type in detail, starting with press fits..."

## SLIDE 2: PRESS FITS - FRICTION CLOSURE (DIN 7190)

### Purpose
Explain press fit mechanics, torque transmission principles, and key characteristics.

### Content Structure

**Part A: Basic Mechanism**
- Torque transmission: Via friction generated by radial interference
- Assembly methods:
  - Shrink fit: Hub heated or shaft cooled
  - Press fit: Force-assembled at ambient temperature
- Result: Radial contact pressure p develops at interface after temperature equalization and elastic recovery

**Part B: Torque Capacity Equation**
- Contact area: A_contact = π d L
- Torque equation: **M_t,press = (π/2) μ p L d²**
  - μ = friction coefficient
  - p = interface pressure
  - L = engagement length
  - d = shaft diameter
- Required pressure: p_req = (2 M_req S_R) / (π μ L d²)
  - S_R = safety factor applied to torque demand
  - Safety factor applied directly to torque demand (not capacity)

**Part C: Allowable Pressure**
- Effective allowable: p_allow = min(p_allow,shaft, p_allow,hub)
- Based on von Mises yield criterion for biaxial stress state
- Factors affecting allowable:
  - Material strength (yield or ultimate, depending on ductility)
  - Geometric configuration (hub wall thickness Q_A = d/D, shaft hollowness Q_I = d_i/d)
  - Thick-walled cylinder theory

**Part D: Key Characteristics**
- **Advantages:**
  - Excellent concentricity (self-centering, uniform radial contact)
  - Backlash-free operation (no clearance, friction resists motion in both directions)
  - Low stress concentration (smooth interface, no geometric discontinuities)
  - Good for high-speed, low-vibration applications
- **Limitations:**
  - Assembly constraints (high press forces or thermal methods)
  - Surface condition sensitivity (contamination, oxidation, lubrication reduce friction)
  - Thin hub limitations (bell-mouthing, non-uniform deformation)
  - Interference limits (practical manufacturability constraints, typically U_w ≤ 0.020mm)

**Visual Elements:**
- **Primary figure:** Press fit properties radar chart (figures/press_fit_properties.png)
  - Shows qualitative characteristics across multiple design criteria
  - Axes: Transmissible torque, Self-centering, Assembly effort, Cost, Disassemblability, Stress concentration
- **Secondary figure (optional):** Friction coefficients table (figures/press_friction_coefficients_DIN7190.pdf.png)
  - Shows DIN 7190 friction coefficient ranges for different material pairings
- **Optional diagram:** Stress types illustration (figures/Types of stresses.png)
  - Shows circumferential (hoop) and radial stresses in cylindrical components

**Key Message:**
"Press fits provide excellent concentricity and backlash-free operation but are limited by assembly constraints and interference manufacturability limits."

**Transition to next slide:**
"Unlike press fits, keys and splines use form closure through geometric interlocking..."

## SLIDE 3: KEYS AND SPLINES - FORM CLOSURE (DIN 6885, DIN 5480)

### Purpose
Explain keyed and splined connection mechanics, failure modes, and characteristics.

### Content Structure

**Part A: Parallel Keys (DIN 6885)**
- Mechanism: Rectangular parallel key engages matching keyways in shaft and hub
- Torque transmission: Via geometric interlocking (form closure)

**Two Failure Modes:**
1. **Shear Failure:**
   - Key cut across by torque
   - Shear-limited capacity: T_τ = τ_allow × b × L × d/2
   - Controlled by key cross-sectional area and shear strength

2. **Bearing (Crushing) Failure:**
   - Key presses against keyway walls
   - Bearing-limited capacity: T_p = p_allow × (h/2) × L × d/2
   - Usually governs, especially for:
     - Larger shafts (torque scales with d³, but key size increases linearly)
     - Softer hub materials (cast iron, aluminum, mild steel have lower compressive yield strength)

**Governing Capacity:**
- M_t,key = min(T_τ, T_p)
- For multi-material connections: p_allow = min(p_allow,shaft, p_allow,hub)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Advantages:**
  - Low cost (standardized components per DIN 6885)
  - Easy assembly/disassembly (simple insertion, no high forces)
  - Good for moderate torque applications
- **Limitations:**
  - Stress concentrations at keyways (reduced fatigue strength)
  - Potential backlash under reversing loads
  - Poor concentricity (does not ensure radial alignment)
  - Bearing pressure often governs (especially larger shafts, softer hubs)

**Part B: Splines (DIN 5480)**
- Mechanism: Multiple interlocking teeth engage matching grooves
- Torque transmission: Via load sharing across multiple teeth

**Torque Capacity:**
- M_t,spline = K × L × z × h_eff × r_m × p_allow
  - z = number of teeth
  - m = module
  - K = load-sharing factor (0.75, accounts for non-uniform load distribution)
  - h_eff ≈ 0.8 × h_proj (effective flank height, conservative reduction)
  - r_m = (d + D)/4 (mean radius)
- Load distribution: Not uniform due to manufacturing tolerances, elastic deformation, misalignment

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Advantages:**
  - High torque capacity (load sharing across multiple teeth)
  - Excellent fatigue behavior (better than keys, worse than press fits)
  - Good concentricity (involute geometry provides accurate radial positioning)
  - Suitable for axial movement (can be designed for controlled sliding)
  - Excellent bidirectional torque capability
- **Limitations:**
  - High manufacturing cost (specialized tooling, tight tolerances)
  - Increased complexity compared to keys and press fits

**Visual Elements:**
- **For Keys:**
  - Key fit diagram (figures/keyfit_diagram.png or figures/key_DIN.jpg)
    - Shows DIN 6885 key dimensions and tolerances
  - Exploded view (figures/key-diagram.jpg)
    - Shows key, keyseat (shaft keyway), hub keyway
  - Key properties radar chart (figures/key_fit_properties.png)
    - Shows qualitative characteristics across design criteria

- **For Splines:**
  - Spline diagram (figures/spline_diagram.png)
    - Shows cross-section with outer diameter D, inner diameter d, tooth width b
  - Spline DIN standard (figures/spline_DIN.jpg)
    - Shows DIN 5480 geometry and dimensions
  - Spline properties radar chart (figures/spline_fit_properties.png)
    - Shows qualitative characteristics across design criteria

**Key Message:**
"Keys offer cost-effective solutions for moderate torque with easy assembly, but suffer from stress concentrations. Splines provide high capacity and durability but at higher manufacturing cost. Bearing pressure often governs in keyed joints, especially for larger shafts or softer hub materials."

**Transition to next slide:**
"These connection types are governed by DIN standards. Let's examine the standards and material considerations..."

## SLIDE 4: DIN STANDARDS AND MATERIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Purpose
Explain the role of DIN standards in analytical modeling and material/contact mechanics principles.

### Content Structure

**Part A: DIN Standards Overview**
- **DIN 7190 (Press Fits/Interference Fits):**
  - Basis for friction-closure connections
  - Defines friction coefficients (Haftbeiwerte) for material pairings and surface conditions
  - Provides formulas for pressure limits based on thick-walled cylinder theory
  - Figure: Friction coefficients table (figures/press_friction_coefficients_DIN7190.pdf.png)

- **DIN 6885 (Parallel Keys):**
  - Standardized key dimensions as function of shaft diameter
  - Defines keyway tolerances
  - Torque capacity based on shear and bearing pressure limits
  - Figure: Key dimensions table (figures/key_DIN.jpg)

- **DIN 5480 (Splines):**
  - Involute spline geometry based on reference diameters
  - Defines module, number of teeth, tolerances
  - Load sharing considerations
  - Figure: Spline geometry (figures/spline_DIN.jpg)

**Key Point:** "Standards define feasibility boundaries but do not prescribe how to select between multiple feasible connection types."

**Part B: Material Properties**
- Materials considered: Structural/alloy steels (S235, C45, 42CrMo4, E360, 16MnCr5), stainless steel (304), cast irons (GG25, GGG40), bronze (CuSn8), aluminum alloys (6061, 7075)
- Key properties:
  - Elastic constants: Young's modulus E, Poisson's ratio ν
  - Strength values: Yield strength σ_y, ultimate tensile strength σ_uts
  - Ductility classification (ductile vs brittle)
  - Safety modifiers: S_F (yield-based), S_B (ultimate-based)

**Part C: Contact Mechanics**
- **For Form-Closure (Keys, Splines):**
  - Allowable shear stresses: Material-specific
  - Bearing pressure limits: Conservative, governed by weaker component
  - p_allow = min(p_allow,shaft, p_allow,hub) for multi-material connections

- **For Friction-Closure (Press Fits):**
  - Friction coefficient μ sensitive to:
    - Material pairing (steel-steel vs steel-aluminum)
    - Surface condition (dry or oiled)
    - Surface roughness
  - Conservative ranges from DIN practice
  - Sampled within bounded intervals during synthetic data generation

**Part D: Elastic Material Properties**
- Hooke's law: E = σ/ε (normal), G = E/[2(1+ν)] (shear)
- Young's modulus E: Material stiffness
- Poisson's ratio ν: Lateral contraction/expansion
- Used in: Press-fit interference deformation estimates, elastic recovery calculations

**Visual Elements:**
- **Optional:** Hooke's law diagram (figures/Hookesches_Gesetz_for_material_properties.jpg)
  - Shows stress-strain relationships, connection between E, G, ν
- **Optional:** Stress-strain curve (figures/Stress-strain curve from a uniaxial tensile test.png)
  - Shows elastic deformation, yield strength, plastic deformation, ultimate strength
  - Basis for von Mises yield criterion

**Key Message:**
"Material properties and DIN standards provide the analytical foundation. Standards define feasibility, but selection requires additional considerations beyond pure mechanical capacity."

**Transition to next slide:**
"Before we can compare connection types, we need to establish feasibility and consider user preferences..."

---

## SLIDE 5: FEASIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS AND PREFERENCE-BASED TRADE-OFFS

### Purpose
Explain how feasibility is established and how user preferences influence selection beyond pure mechanical capacity.

### Content Structure

**Part A: Feasibility Considerations**
- **Basic requirement:** Connection must transmit required torque with appropriate safety margin
- **Mechanical feasibility:**
  - Torque capacity ≥ design torque (M_req × S_R)
  - Within admissible material limits (yield strength, ultimate strength)
  - Within geometric limits (diameter ratios, wall thickness)
- **Practical feasibility:**
  - Avoid non-physical designs (invalid diameter relationships)
  - Avoid unrealistically difficult assembly (e.g., excessive interference)
  - Press fits: Interference limits (typically U_w ≤ 0.020mm for manufacturability)
- **Key point:** "Feasibility serves as prerequisite to preference-based evaluation. Only feasible connections are considered for selection."

**Part B: Preference-Based Engineering Trade-Offs**
- **Problem:** Engineering decisions involve trade-offs beyond torque capacity alone
- **Eight preference dimensions:**
  1. Assembly and disassembly ease
  2. Suitability for axial movement
  3. Cost sensitivity
  4. Bidirectional torque capability
  5. Vibration resistance
  6. High-speed suitability
  7. Maintenance effort and accessibility
  8. Durability and fatigue-related considerations

**Part C: Why Preferences Matter**
- Different connection types exhibit characteristic strengths and weaknesses across these dimensions
- Example trade-offs:
  - Press fits: Excellent concentricity, but difficult disassembly
  - Keys: Low cost, easy assembly, but stress concentrations
  - Splines: High capacity, but high manufacturing cost
- **User-defined preference weighting:** Enables selection decisions that reflect application-specific priorities
- **Key point:** "Selection should not rely solely on mechanical capacity. User preferences enable context-aware decisions."

**Visual Elements:**
- **Comparison table (optional):** Show how each connection type performs across the 8 preference dimensions
- **Simple diagram:** Feasibility filter → Preference scoring → Selection

**Key Message:**
"Feasibility ensures mechanical safety, but preferences enable application-specific optimization. Both are essential for intelligent selection."

**Transition to next slide:**
"Now let's understand how machine learning fits into this framework and how we evaluate model performance..."

- **Role in this thesis:** Complements analytical models by learning subtle patterns and trade-offs difficult to encode explicitly
- **Analytical models:** Provide physically grounded calculations
- **ML models:** Capture complex interactions between multiple factors (geometry, materials, preferences)

**Part B: Supervised Classification**
- **Training process:**
  - Input features: Geometric parameters, materials, preferences
  - Target label: Connection type (determined by analytical scoring system)
  - Dataset split: Training (70-80%), Validation (10-15%), Test (10-20%)
  - Validation: Hyperparameter tuning
  - Test: Unbiased performance estimate
- **Overfitting prevention:** Regularization, early stopping, cross-validation

**Part C: Tree-Based Models**
- **Why tree-based?**
  - Represent nonlinear decision boundaries (mechanical feasibility constraints)
  - Handle mixed data types (numerical + categorical)
  - Well-suited for engineering problems

**Key Models:**

  - **LightGBM:** Histogram-based, leaf-wise growth
  - **CatBoost:** Robust categorical handling, ordered boosting

**Part D: Evaluation Metrics**
- **Classification outcomes:**
  - True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted class
  - False Positives (FP): Incorrectly predicted as class
  - True Negatives (TN): Correctly predicted different class
  - False Negatives (FN): Missed instances of class

**Key Metrics:**
1. **Accuracy:** Overall percentage correct
   - Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN)
   - Limitation: Misleading with imbalanced classes

2. **Precision:** Reliability of predictions
   - Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
   - "Of all predicted as class, how many were actually that class?"

3. **Recall (Sensitivity):** How well model finds all instances
   - Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
   - "Of all actual instances, how many were correctly identified?"

4. **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall
   - F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
   - Balances precision and recall

5. **Macro F1-Score:** Average F1 across all classes
   - Macro F1 = (1/C) × Σ F1_i
   - Ensures all classes weighted equally
   - **Used for model selection in this thesis** (avoids favoring dominant classes)

**Part E: Confusion Matrix**
- **Purpose:** Detailed breakdown of classification performance
- **Structure:** 3×3 table (for 3-class problem: press fit, key, spline)
  - Rows: True classes
  - Columns: Predicted classes
  - Diagonal: Correct predictions (TP for each class)
  - Off-diagonal: Misclassifications (which classes are confused)
- **Use:** Qualitative error analysis, identify systematic misclassification patterns
- **Example:** "Do keys get confused with splines? Do press fits get confused with keys?"

**Visual Elements:**
- **Confusion matrix diagram (figures/conf-matrix3x3.png):**
  - Shows 3×3 structure for three-class problem
  - Illustrates how predictions are distributed
  - Source: researchgate_confusion_matrix_2021
- **Optional:** Simple diagram showing precision vs recall trade-off

**Key Message:**
"Macro F1-score ensures balanced performance across all classes. Confusion matrix reveals which connection types are most easily confused, enabling targeted improvements."

**Transition to next slide:**
"Let's examine the state of the art in engineering design automation to understand where this work fits..."
